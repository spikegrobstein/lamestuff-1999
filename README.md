# Lamestuff.com 1999

This is a snapshot of my personal site lamestuff.com from back in 1999, in the state that it was at that time.

This repo contains some software I wrote in C++ and REALbasic from that time for both Classic MacOS as well as
BeOS.

The site was built in Adobe GoLive 4, and, if I recall correctly, was started using an earlier version of the
software, before it was purchased by Adobe: GoLive Cyberstudio Pro.
